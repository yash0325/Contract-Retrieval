# Contract AI – Automated Contract Query Pipeline
# Contract AI is a Python-based multi-agent workflow for answering contract and legal questions using Large Language Models (LLMs). It parses, indexes, and semantically searches through contract files, then extracts and summarizes relevant legal clauses in response to user questions. The solution leverages LangChain and OpenAI for agentic retrieval, clause extraction, and summarization.

# Features
